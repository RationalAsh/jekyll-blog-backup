<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I've been trying a lot of different software for simulating mechanical systems for my project. By far, the most fun I've had is when I was simulating it on Mathematica. Mathematica is a seriously cool piece of software. I got a simulation of the simple pendulum up and running almost 3 times faster than I did when I was working with Python and Matplotlib. Although, to be fair, the time I did it in Python was the first time I was doing the simulation. So I was learning about how to do the simulation as well as trying to make it. So that might have affected the amount of time I took.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aExL2TP7TEg/VhngQrIbPnI/AAAAAAAAGcY/94e_Ep1oMXc/s1600/SimplePendulum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aExL2TP7TEg/VhngQrIbPnI/AAAAAAAAGcY/94e_Ep1oMXc/s1600/SimplePendulum.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Wv9EApnTzE/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Wv9EApnTzE?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>
