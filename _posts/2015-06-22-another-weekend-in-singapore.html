<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Now I’m working for a lab I guess I have a good idea of what working a 9 to 5 job will be like. I barely have time to do anything on weekdays. Free time has become a very precious resource. So weekends are the only time I get to actually do stuff. And most of the time, after a busy week all I feel like doing on the weekend is relax.<br /><br />I’ve started going to the movies almost every week now. I didn’t have an opportunity to do that in Trichy. The theaters there are horrible. They tend not to show the kind of movies that I want to watch and when they do they either run it at a really inconvenient time or they dub it in Tamil. This place is heaven compared to Trichy. There are so many awesome places to see and visit! And so many good theaters!<br /><br />Last Saturday, I decided to go visit the library. I felt like sitting in a quiet place and relaxing by reading something. I hadn’t done that in a really long time. I browsed around till I found a book that caught my eye. It was “Contact” by Carl Sagan. And I just sat down there and read for the next 4 hours. I really missed doing that. I’d do that a lot when I was a little kid. But after starting college I didn’t have much time to do that.<br /><br />I went back to the library again on Sunday. This time I thought I’d do some reading on machine learning. There were these tables with power sockets on them set aside for people who wanted to do some work in the silence of the library. It was nice to sit there and work. The girl sitting beside me was also studying machine learning apparently. She had this book called “Supervised learning With Complex Valued Neural Networks” on her desk.<br />I think I’ll visit the library at least once a week from now on. It was nice to take a break from the general noise of the city.<br /><br /><br />I took a picture of the library building! It looks pretty cool!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://ift.tt/1H7DoG1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="image" class="alignnone size-full" src="http://ift.tt/1H7DoG1" height="640" title="P_20150620_131309.jpg" width="360" /></a></div></div>
