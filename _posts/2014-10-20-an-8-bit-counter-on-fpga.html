<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So I finally got around to implementing an 8 bit counter on the FPGA that I recently acquired. Turned out to be a lot more difficult than I thought it would be mostly because I was a bit new to writing modules in verilog. I'm still at that stage of learning where I make silly mistakes which are simple but tedious to rectify.<br /><br />Also, the clock of the FPGA is 100MHz. So I also had to divide the clock down to some frequency that was visible to the human eye. But in the end I got it working! The FPGA itself is only just barely visible but I couldn't turn up the lights without completely washing out the blinking LEDs. Oh well ...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-4ba20db338a7b8d4" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D4ba20db338a7b8d4%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1467541571%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D9016428BBFC99AA95846879F1334E109B830D329.534063813B6B72053C8F0B8770B42B7673E27816%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D4ba20db338a7b8d4%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DF73vbs4Soo9wR6WbDb1TaXEox1I&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=http://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?id%3D4ba20db338a7b8d4%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1467541571%26sparams%3Did,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D9016428BBFC99AA95846879F1334E109B830D329.534063813B6B72053C8F0B8770B42B7673E27816%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D4ba20db338a7b8d4%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DF73vbs4Soo9wR6WbDb1TaXEox1I&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><br />I have this problem where I try to go to the advanced sections of new stuff too quickly and then give up because it looks too complicated. I have to keep telling myself to take things one step at a time and build up slowly to more advanced/complicated stuff.<br /><br />So now that this counter is done I think I'll search around for something that's a <i>little</i>&nbsp;bit more complicated than the counter but still within my reach. And slowly build up to something more complicated like Finite State Machines or VGA controllers.</div>
